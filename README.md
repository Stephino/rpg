# Stephino RPG (Game)

Host a stunning browser-based multiplayer RPG (Role-Playing Game) for the first time ever on [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/stephino-rpg).

## Description

Stephino RPG is a browser-based multi-player strategy role-playing game.

The main goal is to expand your empire and complete research activities in order to uncover the history of your species.

You can form cities, attack and spy on other players and robots, send resources between cities, complete research activities and use premium modifiers to boost your gameplay.

Create your own platformer mini-games and play games created by others to earn rewards.

### Demo and Support

You can [access the Demo](https://stephino.com) by simply logging in with a Google or Twitter account.

Real-time support and feedback are available on [Discord](https://discord.gg/32gFsSm).

We strongly believe in the right to be forgotten so when you're done testing the game just click on the "Delete Account" button from the game settings.

A free Desktop Client is available [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/909060) and [GitHub](https://github.com/Stephino/RPG-Client-Desktop).

### Artificial Intelligence

You can play this game by yourself or against robots or other players.

Robots can perform the following tasks:

 * Create buildings according to the Building Advisor
 * Assign workers to buildings
 * Randomly upgrade existing buildings
 * Perform research activities
 
Robots can also perform military activities:

 * Queue military units and ships
 * Estimate the best time for attack
 * Systematically attack other players

### Internationalizatio
Each player is free to choose their own language. 
System messages are translated just-in-time, meaning users can switch their language at any time and the inbox gets translated as well.
Game language settings are separate from your WordPress language options.

### WordPress Multi-site read
You can enable Stephino RPG on your entire network and run different games on each sub-site, similar to the concept of "realms". 

### Platformer
Design your own platformer mini-levels and play games created by others to earn gems!

### Progressive Web Applicatio
The game can be played on any mobile device in landscape mode and on the desktop.
It functions as a progressive web application, handling offline mode and file requests in a way that mimics truly native applications.

### Optimized CPU usag
All game resource and queue changes, convoy updates and robot actions are computed on-demand with time-lapse procedures that are optimized for speed and memory usage.
Database interactions are optimized with minimal and fast select queries and multi-insert and multi-update queries in order provide a seamless real-time experience for all players.
Optional performance optimizations are available in the Game Mechanics.

### Optimized bandwidt
Using progressive web apps, game assets are automatically stored in the browser **cache storage** via service workers.
This results in 2ms fetch times and no requests made to your server, minimizing band width and drastically improving player experience.
Image sprites are used to reduce the number of requests to your server further and all PNG files have been compressed with pngquant.

### Game masters
You can promote players to the rank of game master, allowing them to moderate platformer games, access the Admin Console and more.
Game admins (WordPress site super-admins) cannot be demoted and implicitly have game master abilities.

### Command Line Interface
As a game master, you have complete control over your game.
Just press **Alt+Ctrl+C** to toggle the console and type **help** to list all available commands.
You can add resources to players, change building levels, fast-forward the game and more.

### Dashboard
Get a birds-eye view of your game community in the Game Dashboard.
You can also send announcements to your players; MarkDown syntax is enabled.

### Microtransactions (PRO)
You can enable microtransactions using PayPal and start monetizing your game.

### Audio Experience (PRO)
Plugins uploaded to WorPress.org are limited to 10MB in size so audio files and many other assets had to be packaged with the PRO plugin.
Control the game music and ambiance and enjoy immersive stereo playback.

### Game Mechanics (PRO)
The Game Mechanics is a comprehensive options panel that allows you to customize every aspect of the game from game labels - with internationalization support - to game objects.
Every option and feature is documented in English only.

### Themes (PRO)
You can modify the design of your game to your heart's content directly from your browser.
Themes are meant to be portable, i.e. you can export your game design and game mechanics changes as your very own themes
in the form of Zip archives. 
All themes are licensed under Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike 4.0
